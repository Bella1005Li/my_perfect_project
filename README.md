Group Project Progress Board

Overview
This project visualises group collaboration and progress using Processing (Python Mode). Each team member is represented by a coloured bar that changes from red to yellow to green based on their completion rate. Users can click the bars to update progress, making the data interactive and expressive.

Features  
1. Dynamic colour transition from red → yellow → green using `lerpColor()`.
2. Real-time interactivity through `mousePressed()` events.
3. Visualisation of both individual and group progress.
4. Average progress automatically updates.

How to Run  
1. Open the project in Processing.
2. Switch to Python Mode.
3. Press Run to start the program.
4. Left-click a bar to increase progress, right-click to decrease.

Reflection  
Through this project, I learned how to organise code structure, use iteration to manage multiple data objects, and design interactive systems.
Debugging helped me understand how creative coding combines logic and design to express collaboration visually.
